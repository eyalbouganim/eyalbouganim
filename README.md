<h1 align="center">Hey there! My name is Eyal 👋</h1>

<p align="center">
🎓 Final semester <b>Computer Science</b> student at <b>Bar-Ilan University</b><br>
💡 Passionate about <b>backend development</b>, <b>problem-solving</b>, and building <b>end-to-end applications</b><br>
</p>

<p>To put it simply, the thing that excites me the most is turning nothing into new ideas, then giving it life with software. Learning more and expanding my skills is a must.</p>
