<h1 align="center">Hey there!</h1>

<h2 align="center">My name is Eyal</h2>

<p align="center">
ðŸŽ“ Final semester <b>Computer Science</b> student at <b>Bar-Ilan University</b><br>
ðŸ’¡ Passionate about <b>backend development</b>, <b>problem-solving</b>, and building <b>end-to-end applications</b><br>
To put it simply, the thing that excites me the most is turning nothing into new ideas, then giving it life with software. Learning more and expanding my skills is a must.
